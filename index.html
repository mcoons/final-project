                        <h3>Learning GameMaker Studio Scripting</h3>
                        <p>May 12, 2018</p>
                        <h4>Topic</h4>
                        <p>Learn some scripting for Gamemaker Studio 2 for the Game-hack-a-thon some of us are competing in.  My assignment is to learn how to program moving platforms for our levels.</p>
                        <h4>Set the Stage</h4>
                        <p>I closed all applications except this and the GameMaker Studio 2 application.  I then proceeded to start though the in-app help system and tutorials to familiar myself with the GameMaker scripting language (GML).</p>
                        <a href="http://youtu.be/yl9xokjZYgY">Setting the Stage</a>   
                        <h4>Reflection</h4>
                        <p>The team created a git repo for our project and after cloning it, I copied it to a play directory where I could mess around with learning and not bombard the real repo with all my playing.</p>
                        <p>I implemented moving platforms three different ways, but due to other code we were trying to interface with, I had glitches that were hard to deal with.Playing around and trying to implement the platforms in different ways helped me to learn different facets of the language and gaming engine.  Had I stuck with one implementation, I would not have learned as much about the gaming engine.</p>
                        <p>Minimizing the applications that were open during 'setting the stage' made it easier to navigate between the GameMaker app as well as the Chrome tabs I had opened for research. I did miss a few slack notifications concerning the project though.</p>
                        <p>Hopefully our team can complete a level or two and turn it in before the 3 day time period is over.  We may want to enter more game-hack-a-thons in the near future once we get use to the software.</p>

                        <h3> Work with 2 people I haven't worked with yet</h3>
                        <p>I met this goal due to the hackathon.</p>
                        <p>Working with Andrew and Brevon went well. To start out, we all brainstormed together to come up with our idea.  We then split out the roles since Tom and I were new.  Tom and I worked on the HTMl and CSS while Andrew and Brevon worked on Javascript.</p>
                        <p>I was introduced to concepts that we will soon be learning.  This included API calls.</p>
                        <p>I wouldn't change anything about the actual goal.  Selecting two people to work with is an easy this to do.  Remembering names though needs some work.  Tomorrow I will try this goal again to learn more names and meet more people.</p>

                        <h3>Work on Flexbox for a few hours</h3>
                        <p>I met this goal.  I worked with Flexbox Froggy as well as created my own page.  I find that, so far, when I read through documentation I get more out of it than playing example games.</p>
                        <p>Unfortunately, my flexbox page stopped working and I don't know why.
                            I do believe that I made too many changes and didn't test in between which made it too hard to debug afterwards.</p>
                        <p>Tomorrow I will re-create my page and try again on my personal flexbox page.</p>

                        <h3>Learn at least 2 more names</h3>
                        <p>I met this goal due to the hackathon described in goal 1. I now know the names of Andrew and Brevon.</p>
                        <p>To help with remembering the names, I made a conscious effort to call them by name most of the time that I addressed them.  I also took time looking at them and repeating their names in my head.</p>
                        <p>I need to stop using the crutch "Hey DUDE" instead of using names.</p>
                        <p>I also solidified some other names in my cohort that I didn't know before.  Big Ben and Jittery Josh.  I made sure to actually use their names when I addressed them.  I also did the stare and repeat method described above which seems to work well for me.</p>
                        <p>Tomorrow I will try to learn more names.  I find that taking my own name notes and assigning my own adjective that comes to mind helps.</p>

                        <p>FAILED</p>
                        <p>I worked with Rockin' Rob on the new Website task with whom I had never worked with before but failed to work with another new individual.  The group we were in had other people I had worked with before.</p>
                        <p>I did work with a lot of other individuals throughout the day providing assistance or asking questions but they were people I had worked with in the past.</p>
                        <p>I will have to try to make an effort to find someone that I haven't worked with before.</p>
                        <p>I do believe that it is just more comfortable to group with familiar people.  I will have to get out of my shell a little more.</p>

                        <p>I worked on flexboxing my navbar which seemed to work OK.  I think I accomplished that goal but...</p>
                        <p>When creating the NAV bar using a UL/LI combination I wrapped the LI with Anchor tags to make it all clickable but found out that it doesn't pass validation.  When putting the Anchor tag in the LI it only allows you to click the text.</p>
                        <p>This changed from a Flexbox goal to understanding how to make the anchor clickable.  After playing around and chatting with Josh I found that just "padding" the anchor tag allowed you to size it into a faux button and allowed clicking in any of the padding.</p>
                        <p>It seems that everyone is comfortable and willing to share information when possible.</p>

                        <h3>Compile all notes into an indexed Google Doc</h3>
                        <p>I do believe this goal was met.  I have compiled all the notes that I found into the Doc.  I realized that having all notes in one location is smarter and makes finding things easier especially with the index.</p>
                        <p>To help facilitate this in the future, I have also created a shortcut to the doc as well as added it to my startup pages so it is always there when I start Chrome.</p>
                        <p>Now I just have to make sure that all notes I take are in that document from now on.</p>
                        <p>I may end up creating a few different documents because I started keeping Meetup and Breakout notes in there also which is starting to get large.</p>

                        <p>Date: May 2, 2018</p>
                        <p>Location: Slalom Office, Denver, CO</p>
                        <h4>People I met</h4>
                        <ul class="peopleList">
                            <li>Adam Jacaruso - Slalom - Solution Architect</li>
                            <li>Siegmund Nagel - Slalom - Consultant</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>What I Learned</h4>
                        <p>I learned that Firebase is a decent service for quick deployment.  I asked Adam about the authentication options and found out that you can integrate authentication through other apps like facebook as well as having general username and passwords.</p>
                        <p>I also learned that Googles Firebase services have other options you can incorporate other than hosting and authentication, like Cloud Storage, a database server, performance monitoring and a test lab</p>
                        <h4>Questions I Have</h4>
                        <p>I would be interested in knowing to what extent I could use Google services like Firebase to deploy simple apps and how popular your app would have to be before you hit their limits and actually had to start paying for quota increases.</p>
                        <p>I would also like to spend some time looking into their test lab to see what it has to offer.</p>

                        <ul class="peopleList">
                            <li>Michael Dusing - Organizer</li>
                            <li>Brent Marquez - Self Employed Web Developer</li>
                            <li>Taylor Kaplan - CEO of Centari</li>

                        </ul>
                        <h4>What I Learned</h4>
                        <p>Michael and Kyle have a podcast Sprint UX that I would like to watch at least once.</p>
                        <p>In general I learned that the devs that show up all seem to be very friendly and have very diverse backgrounds.  Everyone seemed to be very outgoing and friendly.  Forcing myself to attend more meetups like this should help become more comfortable around people and help me to shed my introvert shell.</p>
                        <p>Sarah is working on her capstone project that involves connecting people that like to hike with those that like similar challenges.  Hearing her talking about the different APIs available and all the information you can get excites me about the future and possibilities.</p>
                        <p></p>
                        <h4>Questions I Have</h4>
                        <p> I noticed a lot of people with "Im looking" stickers and it makes me wonder how hard it may be to find a job while staying around the area.</p>
